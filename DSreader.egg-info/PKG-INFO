# DSreader
Tools for reading vegetation maps created in the 'Digitale 
Standaard' data format, developed by the Dutch National Forestry 
Service ('Staatsbosbeheer').

## Why DSreader?
Staatsbosbeheer is a Dutch governmental institute that manages 
over 200.000 hectare of nature areas in the Netherlands. To monitor 
changes in time vegetation maps are made about every twelve years.
Each map is available in the Digital Standard data format, that 
consists of:
1. Shapefiles with polygones and lines of mapped elements.
2. Microsoft Access database with non-spatial information about the 
vegetation types and vegetation quality. 

The field ElmID is used to connect spatial information in the shapefile 
elements to the vegetation data in the datbase. The python package 
DSreader can be used to read data and export data to shapefiles or to 
analyse data in a vegetation map.
